# Giphy Markdown Link Chrome Extension
Copy a Giphy's GIF link in markdown format so it's ready to be pasted into markdown files

## Why?
The copy link available in GIPHY allows you to copy the GIF's link but if you want to add this GIF to a markdown file (in pull requests, issues or just generally any markdown file), you'd have to add some syntax to make this GIF markdown ready. 

Wouldn't it be amazing to copy this GIF's link in markdown-ready format? This is exactly why I built this extension - to reduce the need to manually write the syntax. Just directly copy the link from the GIPHY page itself. 

Hope you enjoy this extension!
