# Giphy Markdown Link Chrome Extension
Copy a Giphy's GIF link in markdown format so it's ready to be pasted into markdown files

## Why?
I've had the need to copy gif's to a markdown based pull request on file and I've always had to first copy the link and then wrap the link in markdown syntax. This extension reduces the need to manually write the syntax. Just directly copy the link from the GIPHY page itself.
